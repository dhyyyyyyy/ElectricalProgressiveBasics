  "game:gamemechanicinfo-electricalprogressive-text": "<strong>Electricity: ElectricalProgressive Mod</strong><br>This mod introduces electrical energy, electrical appliances, devices, weapons, and armor to the game. These additions aim to simplify (or complicate) survival, reduce repetitive tasks, and diversify gameplay.<br><br><strong>Basics</strong><br>The law of energy conservation states that energy cannot be created or destroyed—it only transforms or transfers between forms. This principle applies in-game as well.<br><br>The primary source of mechanical energy is windmills. Generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy by transferring torque from a windmill to a generator via shafts and/or gears. Once connected, the generator begins producing electricity.<br><br>Electrical energy is transmitted via cables to consumers. Place cables along blocks in the desired direction. Each block face can hold up to 4 cables, allowing branching and complex circuit layouts. Cables must connect to the iron plate of an electrical device to activate it. Electrical devices and metal blocks can also conduct current.<br><br>Since wind strength fluctuates, generators may not always produce enough energy. To mitigate this, connect your circuit to batteries. They store excess energy and supply it to devices even when wind is absent.<br><br>To conserve energy, disconnect unused devices using a manual switch. Install switches in parts of the circuit where quick power toggling is needed.<br><br>For devices requiring mechanical energy, use engines. Engines convert electrical energy back into mechanical energy. Connect them to devices via shafts. When active, engines attempt to deliver maximum torque, so ensure sufficient energy in the circuit.",

Connect them via cables and shafts.<br><br><strong>Game Mechanics</strong><br>Motors and generators simulate real-world DC machines. To use them effectively, understand their governing principles.<br>All rotating mechanisms (e.g., shafts, gears) have two parameters: <i>torque</i> (rotational force) and <i>resistance</i> (friction/losses). Shafts and gears have zero torque. The game sums all torque and resistance values to calculate shaft speed (<i>speed</i>) and acceleration/deceleration. If torque exceeds resistance, speed increases; otherwise, it decreases. Resistance typically increases with speed.<br><br><strong>Generators</strong><br>Generator parameters:<br><i>I_max</i> – max energy output;<br><i>speed_max</i> – max nominal rotation speed;<br><i>resistance_factor</i> – resistance multiplier;<br><i>resistance_load</i> – base resistance (achieved at <i>I_max</i>).<br><br>Power output depends on shaft speed: <br><i>power = I_max *(1 – (|speed| / speed_max – 1)^4 )</i>.<br>Output rises rapidly from zero and plateaus at <i>I_max</i> when <i>speed_max</i> is exceeded.<br>Resistance increases linearly below <i>speed_max</i> and quadratically above it. Resistance also scales with the generator's electrical load. Minimal load results in minimal resistance.<br><br><strong>Motors</strong><br>Motor parameters:<br><i>I_min</i> – min energy required to operate;<br><i>I_max</i> – max energy consumption;<br><i>torque_max</i> – max torque;<br><i>kpd_max</i> – peak efficiency;<br><i>speed_max</i> – max nominal speed;<br><i>resistance_factor</i> – resistance multiplier.<br><br>Motor torque is proportional to available energy. Efficiency peaks at 70% of <i>torque_max</i>, following a parabolic curve (downward-opening) up to <i>kpd_max</i>, then drops to 90% of <i>kpd_max</i> at <i>torque_max</i>.<br>Motor resistance uses the same calculation as generators, but <i>resistance_load</i> is zero.",

To prevent burnout, reinforce cables by placing more of the same type on existing cables. However, energy loss (Joule-Lenz Law) increases with current. For long-distance transmission, use higher voltages or batteries as buffers.<br><br><strong>Voltage</strong><br>Devices now require specific voltage levels. Exceeding voltage damages devices/cables.
